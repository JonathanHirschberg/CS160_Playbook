CS160_Playbook
==============

Coach's Playbook project for iPhone, built through a team effort as part of the coursework for CS 160 - User Interface Design at UC Berkeley.  I worked on the Playbook part that allows users to draw plays frame by frame and save them.  http://vis.berkeley.edu/courses/cs160-sp10/wiki/index.php/FinalReport-Group:CoachClass
